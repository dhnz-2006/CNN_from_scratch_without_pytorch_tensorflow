# CNN_from_scratch

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from Scratch with NumPy
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy â€” no deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The goal of this project is to understand the inner workings of CNNs by manually coding convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, along with backpropagation.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Pure NumPy-based implementation â€” no external ML libraries.

Custom convolution and pooling layers.

Forward and backward propagation implemented from scratch.

Support for classification tasks.

Modular structure for easy experimentation.

Example training loop for a small dataset.
